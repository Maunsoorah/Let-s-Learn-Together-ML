Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. In this article, the first part of a 4-part series, we will explore the basic concepts of machine learning and discover how it works and transforms the way we live and work.

#### What is Machine Learning

Machine learning, a significant component of the developing discipline of data science, uses statistical techniques and training algorithms to produce predictions and unearth crucial insights that can influence key growth in all spheres of human life and drive decision-making inside enterprises. Many industries use machine learning to automate processes and perform intricate data analysis because it allows computers to learn from data and enhance their performance over time.

#### Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: In this type of ML, machine learning models are trained using labelled data sets that will allow the models to learn and become more accurate over time. The Algorithm is provided with a set of data which contains the right answers for each of the input values. The machine is then tasked with the duty of predicting the right answers by analysing the dataset correctly. Types of supervised learning include regression and classification.

Unsupervised learning: This is a type of machine learning where the program analyses a set of data that has no labels and tries to find patterns and relationships. It then groups similar data points together and identifies underlying structures in the data. Types of Unsupervised learning are Clustering and Association.

Reinforcement Learning: This is a type of machine learning where an Artificial intelligence (AI) agent learns to make decisions through trial and error. The goal is for the agent to interact with an environment and receive feedback in the form of rewards or punishment  and learn which actions lead to the most rewards and to take those actions in the future.

#### Applications of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is rapidly transforming the way we interact with technology and has many applications in different industries such as facial recognition, Natural Language processing, predictive analytics, recommendation systems, Fraud detection and Healthcare.  

Let's take a look at some real-world applications of machine learning:

•	Virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Google assistants make use of machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands.
•	Online retailers such as  Ebay and Amazon use ML to recommend products and services to their customers based on their past purchases and searches.
•	Healthcare uses ML to analyse medical images, identify diseases and develop personalised treatment plans.
•	Financial institutions and credit card companies use ML to detect fraudulent transactions and prevent financial losses by checking transaction history and user behaviours to detect patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activites.
•	Social media platforms such as facebook and Twitter use ML to personalise the user experience and recommend contents to users based on their interest patterns.
Other applications include but are not limited to use in transportation for self-driving cars and traffic prediction, agriculture and drug discovery.

In the next part of this series: "Getting Started with Machine Learning" - We will focus on the practical side of machine learning, including how to choose and prepare data, and how to select and evaluate models.
